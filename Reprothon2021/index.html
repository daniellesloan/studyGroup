<h3 id="what-is-it-all-about">What is it all about?</h3>

Reproducibility is important across all research, whether this is open access articles, repeatable results or giving access to code and data used for a paper. However, if you have ever tried to rerun old code and it has failed, you are not alone! 
</br>
</br>
<p>So what can we do maximise the longevity, and therefore reproducibility, of our code? That is what the ASG Reprothon 2021 aims to answer! Collating data on code reproducibility for the first time, the Reprothon will provide robust evidence on what factors are determining the longevity of code.</p> 
</br>
<b>In our Reprothon, we are aiming to determine what factors affect the reproducibility of R code.</b>
</br> 
</br>
<p><b>To do this, contributors will work through queries taken from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" style="color:DodgerBlue">StackOverflow</a>, checking whether or not the accepted answer still works. Each participant will submit their results through a simple form which will go into a master spreadsheet along with details such as the package used and any error that occured. </b></p>
</br>
<p>We will track our progress live, and after the closing date, the organisers will analyse this data and produce a blog with our findings, with the aim to provide researchers with guidelines to ensure their code remains usable beyond publishing.</p>
</br>


<h4 id="what-is-a-hackathon">So what is a hackathon?</h4>  

<p>A hackathon, very simply, is an event where lots of people come together to work on a coding or programming problem. The Reprothon is ASGâ€™s second hackathon! 
</br>
</br>
If you want a look at what a previous hackathon for MozSprint was like, our founder <a href="https://github.com/FrancescaMancini" style="color:DodgerBlue">Francesca Mancini</a> shared her experience in 2017 as a <a href="https://francescamancini.github.io/MozSprint/" style="color:DodgerBlue">blog.</a></p>
